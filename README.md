# Classic-Snake-Game-Python-OOP-Edition
A modern take on the classic Snake game built with Python and Turtle. Designed using OOP principles with clean, modular code. This was my first professional project and showcases my foundation in game logic, animation, and event-driven programming.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************
During the days when even my closest friends stopped believing in me,  
I made a quiet decision: to learn programming.

This repository — this journey — is part of that challenge.  
Not just to prove something to them… but to myself.  
That I can still grow. That I can still rebuild.

Maybe by sharing it, I'll get better.  
Maybe one day, someone else will read this and realize — they can too.
